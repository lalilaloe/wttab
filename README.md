# wttab - Programmatically open Windows Terminal tab or window

## Install

`npm install wttab`

\* Make sure you have [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) installed

## Usage

The package is mostly in line with [ttab](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttab) so you can quickly use existing commands/scripts by putting a `w` in front of `ttab`.

```
$ wttab --help
